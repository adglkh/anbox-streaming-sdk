# Anbox Streaming SDK

The Anbox Streaming SDK enables the development of custom streaming clients using JavaScript. This SDK manages all aspects of streaming, from the WebRTC protocol to the handling of controls, gamepads, speakers, and screen resolutions. Additionally, it includes an Android library that provides user-friendly native components such as AnboxWebView, extending the AOSP WebView. This library enhances text input handling for hybrid applications that load the Anbox Streaming JavaScript SDK with an embedded WebView for video streaming.
