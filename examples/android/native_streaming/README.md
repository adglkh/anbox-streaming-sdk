# Anbox Stream SDK - Android Example

This example demonstrates how to use the native Anbox Stream SDK in an Android
application. The application itself is kept simple and mainly concentrates on showing the
integration with the Anbox Stream SDK itself.

## Configure Project

The example project can be build with Android Studio but needs to be configured first to
know where to find the Anbox Stream SDK header and binary files. For that add the
following to your local.properties file

anbox-stream-sdk.dir=/path/to/unpacked/anbox-streaming-sdk

This will tell the build where to look for the header and binary files.

Afterwards you can build and run the Android application with Android Studio as usual.
